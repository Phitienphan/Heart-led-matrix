# Heart LED Display Simulation with 8051

Simulating heart display on Proteus, programming for 8051 to display a heart shape on the designed LED matrix. The heart image remains intact for 1 second, then it gradually disappears with each LED turning off from left to right, from top to bottom, with each LED disappearing after every 0.1s. After the heart image completely disappears, the loop restarts by displaying the entire heart shape again on the LED matrix.
